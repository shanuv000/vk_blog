- **Blur Data URLs**: Custom-generated blur placeholders for smooth loading

## üì± Responsive Design

### Breakpoint-Optimized Sizes
```javascript
// Featured Posts
sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, (max-width: 1024px) 33vw, 25vw"

// Post Cards
sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"

// Hero Images
sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 90vw, 1200px"
```

### Aspect Ratio Support
- **16:9**: Standard for featured and post images
- **21:9**: Ultra-wide for hero images
- **1:1**: Square for avatars and thumbnails
- **4:3**: Traditional for gallery images
- **3:2**: Landscape photography
- **2:3**: Portrait orientation

## üé® Animation & UX Features

### Smooth Transitions
- **Fade-in Duration**: 500ms with custom easing `[0.4, 0, 0.2, 1]`
- **Skeleton Exit**: 300ms fade-out for seamless transitions
- **Hover Effects**: Enhanced scale and transform animations
- **Staggered Loading**: Progressive reveal with delay offsets

### Professional Loading States
