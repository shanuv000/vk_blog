Your `.env.local` file now includes:
```bash
SENTRY_ORG=urtechy-r0
SENTRY_PROJECT=urtechy-blog
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=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

NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
```

### ✅ Build Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ No Sentry-related errors
- ✅ All configuration files in place
- ✅ Auth token configured

---

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production Deployment

### Step 1: Add to Vercel (or your hosting platform)

Go to your Vercel project settings → Environment Variables and add:

```bash
SENTRY_ORG=urtechy-r0
SENTRY_PROJECT=urtechy-blog
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=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
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
```

**Important**: Add these for all environments:
- ✅ Production
- ✅ Preview
- ✅ Development

### Step 2: Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Sentry error tracking integration"
git push
```

Or deploy directly through Vercel dashboard.

### Step 3: Verify

After deployment:
1. Visit your production site
2. Trigger a test error (optional - see testing section below)
3. Go to https://sentry.io/organizations/urtechy-r0/projects/urtechy-blog/
4. Verify errors appear within 1-2 minutes

---

## 🧪 Testing Sentry

### In Development (Local)

Errors are logged to console but NOT sent to Sentry:
```
npm run dev
```

You'll see: `"Sentry Event (dev mode - not sent): {...}"`

### Test Error Capture

Add this to any page temporarily:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

// In your component:
<button 
  onClick={() => {
    Sentry.captureMessage("Test message from urTechy Blog");
    throw new Error("Test Sentry Error");
  }}
>
  Test Sentry
</button>
```

### In Production

After deploying, visit the test page and click the button. Check Sentry dashboard after 1-2 minutes.

## 🔐 Security Notes

### ⚠️ Your Auth Token

Your Sentry auth token is:
```
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
```

**Security Best Practices**:
- ✅ Already in `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- ✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- ⚠️ Add to Vercel as environment variable
- ⚠️ Never commit this token to GitHub
- ⚠️ Rotate token if accidentally exposed

### Token Permissions

This token has:
- `project:releases` - Upload source maps
- `project:write` - Create releases
- `org:read` - Read organization data

---

## 💰 Free Tier Usage

### Your Limits
- **5,000 errors/month**
- **10,000 performance units/month**

### Your Configuration (Optimized)
- **Sample Rate**: 10% (captures 1 in 10 events)
- **Effective Capacity**: ~50,000 errors/month, ~100,000 transactions/month
- **Development**: Doesn't count against quota ✅

### Monitor Usage
Check usage at: https://sentry.io/organizations/urtechy-r0/stats/

If approaching limits:
- Lower sample rate: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.05`
- Add more error filters
- Review noisy errors

## 🎯 Quick Commands

```bash
# Development (Sentry logs to console only)
npm run dev

# Build (with Sentry source maps)
npm run build

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Production
npm start
```

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [✅] Sentry account created
- [✅] Project configured: urtechy-blog
- [✅] Auth token obtained
- [✅] Local environment variables set
- [✅] Build tested successfully
- [✅] Configuration files verified
- [ ] Production environment variables added to Vercel
- [ ] Deployed to production

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

If build fails with Sentry error:
```bash
# Rebuild Sentry
npm rebuild @sentry/nextjs

# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

### Errors Not Appearing

1. Check environment: Must be production (not development)
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for ingestion
3. Verify DSN in config files
4. Check error isn't filtered in `ignoreErrors`

### Source Maps Not Working

1. Verify `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in Vercel
2. Check build logs for upload confirmation
3. Ensure token has `project:releases` scope
