## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 2. Unused Categories (0 Posts)

These categories exist but have **no posts assigned**. They clutter your CMS and confuse content organization:

**Visible but Empty (Delete or hide):**
- None identified yet (need full post count)

**Hidden and Empty (Safe to delete):**
- Automobile
- Bike

- code
- DC
- Esports
- Finance
