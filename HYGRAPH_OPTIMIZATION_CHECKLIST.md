# Hygraph API Optimization Checklist

## ✅ Performance Optimizations
- [ ] All queries have limits validation (max 50)
- [ ] Image queries include transformation parameters
- [ ] Caching implemented with appropriate TTLs
- [ ] Connection-based pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Query result size monitoring
- [ ] Error handling with graceful fallbacks

## 🔧 Technical Improvements  
- [ ] Consolidated query fragments to reduce duplication
- [ ] Performance monitoring and logging
- [ ] Query complexity analysis
- [ ] Cache hit rate monitoring (target: >80%)
- [ ] Slow query detection and optimization

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Query performance dashboard
- [ ] Cache effectiveness metrics
- [ ] API usage tracking
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Response time analysis

## 🛡️ Production Readiness
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Request deduplication
- [ ] Stale-while-revalidate caching
- [ ] Graceful degradation strategies
- [ ] Health check endpoints
