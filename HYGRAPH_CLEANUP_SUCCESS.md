## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Token Permissions
- Initial token had read-only access → all mutations failed with 403
- Updated token with **Update**, **Delete**, and **Publish** permissions → success!
- Always verify token permissions before attempting mutations

### Data Analysis
- CDN API perfect for read operations (no auth needed)
- Content API required for mutations (auth required)
- Python post-processing very effective for data analysis

### Cleanup Strategy
- **Phase 1** (make visible) before **Phase 2** (delete) worked well
- Rate limiting (500ms) prevented API throttling
- Publishing immediately after update ensured changes were live

## ✅ Verification

Run this query to verify:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-ap-south-1.hygraph.com/v2/cky5wgpym15ym01z44tk90zeb/master \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  -d '{"query": "query { categories { id name slug show } }"}'
```

**Expected Result**:
- All 16 categories have `"show": true`
- No categories with `"show": false`
