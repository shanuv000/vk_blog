# ðŸ”§ Tag Display Fix - GraphQL Queries Updated

## Issue Identified
Tags were not visible on posts because the GraphQL queries were not fetching tag data from Hygraph.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/services/apollo-services.js` âœ…
**Updated Queries:**
- `getPostDetails` - Added tags to POST_DETAILS_QUERY
- `getPostDetails` - Added tags to ALTERNATIVE_QUERY  
- `getPosts` - Added tags to POSTS_QUERY

**Tag Fields Added:**
```graphql
tags {
  id
  name
  slug
  color {
    hex
  }
}
```

### 2. `/services/index.js` âœ…
**Updated Queries:**
- Main `GetPostDetails` query - Added tags
- `GetPostDetailsAlternative` query - Added tags

### 3. `/services/pagination.js` âœ…
**Updated Fragment:**
- Full fields fragment now includes tags

### 4. `/services/optimizedQueries.js` âœ…
**Already Updated:**
- `POST_DETAILS` query has tags (from previous update)
- `POSTS_STANDARD` query has tags (from previous update)
- `tagsBasic` fragment defined

## UI Components (Already Implemented)

### `/components/PostDetail.jsx` âœ…
- Tags displayed after post title and metadata
- Uses `<TagList>` component
- Conditionally rendered when tags exist

### `/components/PostCard.jsx` âœ…
- Shows up to 3 tags per card
- Uses `<TagBadge>` component with small size
- "+X more" indicator for posts with >3 tags

### `/components/TagBadge.jsx` âœ…
- Color-coded tag pills
- Dynamic text color based on background luminance
- Hover effects
- Clickable (ready for tag pages)

### `/components/TagList.jsx` âœ…
- Multiple tags container
- Flexible sizing
- Responsive layout

## What Was Missing

The frontend components were correctly implemented, but the backend queries weren't fetching the tag data from Hygraph. This meant:

- `post.tags` was `undefined` or `null`
- Conditional check `{post.tags && post.tags.length > 0}` always failed
- No tags were displayed

## Solution

Updated all GraphQL queries that fetch post data to include the `tags` field with:
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `name` - Display name
- `slug` - URL-friendly identifier
- `color.hex` - Color code for styling

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Dev Server** - Required for GraphQL query changes to take effect
2. **Clear Browser Cache** - Ensure fresh data is loaded
3. **Test Tags Display**:
   - Check individual post pages (PostDetail)
   - Check blog listing pages (PostCard)
   - Verify tag colors are showing correctly
4. **Verify in Hygraph** - Confirm posts have tags assigned

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Restart dev server
npm run dev

# Or kill and restart
# Ctrl+C then npm run dev
```

## Expected Result

After restarting the dev server, you should see:
- âœ… Tags displayed below post title/date on detail pages
- âœ… Up to 3 tags on each post card in listings
- âœ… Color-coded tag badges with proper styling
- âœ… Hover effects working on tags
