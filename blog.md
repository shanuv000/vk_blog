## üßæ U.S.-China Trade Truce: Details and Implications

Following intense negotiations in **Geneva**, the U.S. and China reached a temporary agreement to ease economic tensions. This 90-day trade truce is expected to take effect on **May 14, 2025**, and aims to:

- **Rollback Tariffs**:
  - The **U.S.** will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports from **145% to 30%**.
  - **China** will slash tariffs on U.S. goods from **125% to 10%**.

  China has also agreed to lift recent restrictions on exports of **rare-earth minerals**, key to global tech manufacturing.

- **Facilitate Further Talks**:  
  A rotating negotiation forum between the U.S., China, and neutral countries is planned to draft a permanent framework.

### üìà Market Reactions

The global financial markets **responded enthusiastically**:

- **S&P 500**: +3.2%  
- **Nasdaq**: +4.4%  
- **Dow Jones**: +1,100 points  
- Oil and commodity prices surged amid hopes of economic normalization.

Even retail investor sentiment in India mirrored this optimism. As covered in our blog on [record ‚Çπ26,632 crore SIP inflows](https://blog.urtechy.com/post/record-26632-crore-sip-inflows-april-2025), Indian investors showed growing confidence in equity markets, echoing global trends.

## üíä Trump‚Äôs Drug Pricing Reform: Bold but Controversial

In a surprise move, President Trump signed an executive order mandating **prescription drug price cuts of 30‚Äì80%** under a new "**Most Favored Nation (MFN)**" pricing strategy. This reform targets both **Medicare** and **Medicaid** spending, with the following features:

### üß¨ Key Mechanisms

- **MFN Benchmarking**:  
  U.S. prices will be pegged to the **lowest rates** paid by countries like **Germany, Canada, and the UK**.

- **30-Day Compliance Window**:  
  Drugmakers have a month to lower prices voluntarily. Failure to do so will trigger **government-imposed caps**.

- **Direct-to-Consumer Initiatives**:  
  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), led by **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.**, is authorized to facilitate **bulk buying programs** and **import cheaper alternatives**.

- **Trump‚Äôs Statement**:  
  > ‚ÄúAmericans are tired of getting ripped off. This order will save **trillions** and finally bring fairness to drug pricing,‚Äù said Trump on Truth Social.

## üíº Industry Reactions & Legal Challenges

### üß™ Pharmaceutical Industry Response

- **PhRMA CEO Stephen Ubl** called it ‚Äúa bad deal for American patients,‚Äù citing risks to **R&D investment**.
- Companies like **Merck** and **Pfizer** initially saw stock dips but later rebounded as the market assessed implementation risks.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Experts Weigh In

- **Paul Kim**, a healthcare attorney, stated:  
  > ‚ÄúThis stretches the statute significantly. A flood of litigation is expected.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt the first attempt either; a **similar MFN proposal was blocked** in 2021, leading to doubts over this version‚Äôs survivability in court.
